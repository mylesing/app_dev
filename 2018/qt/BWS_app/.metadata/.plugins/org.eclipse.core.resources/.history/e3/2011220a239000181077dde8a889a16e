/**
 * This is the class for running TOPSIS.
 * It sorts items based on their attributes and a set weights.
 * It stores an unchangeable decision matrix that contains
 * the items and their values for each attribute. It takes in
 * a set of weights (a person's preferences that we get from BWS)
 * and orders the items with those weights applied. The class
 * allows for setting the weights, and getting the ideal and
 * negative-ideal orderings of the items. The ideal ordering is
 * the ordering where the items will be in order of demonstrating 
 * the highest amounts of the most preferred attributes. The 
 * negative-ideal solution means the items will be in order of
 * demonstrating the least amounts of the most preferred
 * attributes.
